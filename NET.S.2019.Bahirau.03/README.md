# Day 3
### EPAM-Training-ASP.NET-MVC

#### Tasks:

+ Create a class that allows you to perform GCD calculations using the Euclidean algorithm for two, 
three, etc. integers. Class methods in addition to calculating the GCD should determine the value of 
the time required to perform the calculation. **Add to the created class methods** that implement 
the Stein algorithm (binary Euclidean algorithm) to calculate the GCD of two, three, etc. integers. 
Methods must also determine the time required to perform the calculations. 
Add unit tests.

+ Implement the extension method to get a string binary 
representation of a real double-precision number in IEEE 754 format 
(it is advisable not to use ready-made converter classes). 
Add unit tests.
