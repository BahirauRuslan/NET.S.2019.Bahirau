# Day 4
### EPAM-Training-ASP.NET-MVC

#### Tasks:

1. Create an immutable Polynomial class (polynomial) for working with degree polynomials 
of one real type variable (use the sz-array as the internal structure for storing coefficients). 
For the developed class, override the virtual methods of the Object class and overload the operations 
allowed for working with polynomials (excluding the division of a polynomial by a polynomial), 
including “==” and “!=”. Add unit tests.

2. Implement the algorithm of the “bubble” sorting of a non-rectangular 
(jagged array) integer array (**do not use sorting methods of the System.Array class**) 
so that it is possible to order the rows of the matrix:
	+ in ascending (descending) amounts of matrix row elements;
	+ in ascending (descending) order of maximum elements of matrix rows;
	+ in ascending (descending) order of minimum elements of matrix rows;
Add unit tests.
