# Day 2
### EPAM-Training-ASP.NET-MVC

#### Tasks:

+ Implement the **InsertNumber** method, which takes two integers and two positions of bits i and j (i <j). 
The algorithm inserts the bits of the second number into the first, 
so that the bits of the second number take positions from bit j to bit i (bits are numbered from right to left). 
Add NUnit and (!) MS Unit Test to test the method.

+ Implement the **FindNextBiggerNumber** method, which takes a positive integer and
returns the closest largest integer consisting of the digits of the original number, and - 1 (null)
if no such number exists. Add NUnit or MS Unit tests.

+ Add to the **FindNextBiggerNumber** method the ability to return the time of finding the specified number,
having considered various language options. Add NUnit or MS Unit tests.

+ Implement the **FilterDigit** method which accepts 
a list of integers and filters the list so that only numbers containing 
the specified digit are left. Do not use LINQ! For example, for the number 7, 
FilterDigit (7, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 68, 69, 70, 15, 17) -> {7, 70, 17}. 
Add NUnit or MS Unit tests.

+ Implement the **FindNthRoot** algorithm, which allows 
calculating the nth root (n ∈ N) using the Newton method with a given accuracy. 
Add NUnit or MS Unit tests.
